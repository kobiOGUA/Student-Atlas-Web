you're almost there. the app sorta still logs me out but it lets me see everything. I want it to be that I retain the session and dont log out so I can still see all the gpa and everything. so please find a fix so that I never get logged out. then for community stuff. remove the reply just keep the like then make like to be a button so if you click it, it adds one like. the app is almost done. just sort out the session/logout thing and these other things and build it. also note that when I click log out, it should log me out then take me to login page not do nothing. the current app is quite good but again. when I close it. I'm taken to the home page but I'm not logged in. so please find a way to make session reconnects or just anyway that I can stay logged in. you can try using the same type of code you usede for the themes since those dont change. if the login system doesnt work, then we will switch to a passkey login. but just try fixing it first. I'll tell you if we need to go the other route
