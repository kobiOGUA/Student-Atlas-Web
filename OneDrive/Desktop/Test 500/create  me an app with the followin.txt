create  me an app with the following specifications: the firebase is as follows: To make the google-services.json config values accessible to Firebase SDKs, you need the Google services Gradle plugin.


Kotlin DSL (build.gradle.kts)

Groovy (build.gradle)
Add the plugin as a dependency to your project-level build.gradle.kts file:

Root-level (project-level) Gradle file (<project>/build.gradle.kts):
plugins {
  // ...

  // Add the dependency for the Google services Gradle plugin
  id("com.google.gms.google-services") version "4.4.4" apply false

}
Then, in your module (app-level) build.gradle.kts file, add both the google-services plugin and any Firebase SDKs that you want to use in your app:

Module (app-level) Gradle file (<project>/<app-module>/build.gradle.kts):
plugins {
  id("com.android.application")

  // Add the Google services Gradle plugin
  id("com.google.gms.google-services")

  ...
}

dependencies {
  // Import the Firebase BoM
  implementation(platform("com.google.firebase:firebase-bom:34.6.0"))


  // TODO: Add the dependencies for Firebase products you want to use
  // When using the BoM, don't specify versions in Firebase dependencies
  implementation("com.google.firebase:firebase-analytics")


  // Add the dependencies for any other desired Firebase products
  // https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup#available-libraries
}
By using the Firebase Android BoM, your app will always use compatible Firebase library versions. Learn more
After adding the plugin and the desired SDKs, sync your Android project with Gradle files., then make it so that the user doesn't have to log in everytime thy open the app. if the user legs in, they stay logged in until they log out despite the app being closed.  this is my student atlas app. I want to add improvements such that courses are grouped by semesters whereby semesters are like folders. then when you create a semester you're asked if it's a past or present semester. if it's a past semester, you'll be asked to enter all the courses from that semester and the unit hours of the course then what you scored in the course. the grade will be calculated automatically using the system we have already. then from all that, the semester gpa is calculated and displayed. all gpas are on a 5 point scale. for present semesters, you're asked to enter courses for the semester then that's where you can do the normal app functions but remember to also ask for the units of each course. then from the CA calculations and certainty predictions, we can go ahead and add a predicted gpa. there should be a gpa section in the app where you can display the current cgpa and also the predicted cgpa after the current semester then also all semester gpas. also in a current semester, there can be an option to add final score out of 100. this is assuming the student has seen their result. when this is done for each course, then the semester becomes a past semester. there can only be one current semester at a time. then also student should be able to edit all semesters and delete them also. for viewing modes, there should be the default, dark, blue, light pink, and light. additionally, add any features you think would enhance the app even more and make it perfect. Also make it so that the default grading and gpa system is Babcock University. mention that other systems will come in future updates. make sure the app is beautifully animated and attractive.
