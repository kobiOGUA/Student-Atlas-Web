for registration, there shouldnt be two numpads on the same page. the confirmation can still exist but with just one numpad. also, I think you should just make the entire thing again but using html, css, and javascript with the provided firebase. please make it EXACTLY like the app. each page in the app should have a corresponding page in the website. ensure it looks almost identical and is dark mode by default. tehn check with the firebase with everythign I gave you and keep it cross platform so that auth works across devices, as well as semesters, courses, community posts, settings, replies and everything else
